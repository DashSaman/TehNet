# TehNet Agent Handoff

## Current state
Foundation, WordPress bootstrap, SEO architecture, YouTube mapping, the first MikroTik Learn hub, and the five approved Services owner pages are implemented and verified in production. The site intentionally remains non-indexable.

## Verified production
- Domain: `https://tehnet.ir`
- TehNet host binding: `127.0.0.1:18082`
- Active theme/plugin: `tehnet` / `tehnet-core`
- Main top-level routes return HTTP 200, one H1 each, correct canonicals and `noindex,nofollow`.
- `blog_public=0`; do not enable indexing yet.
- `/wp-sitemap.xml` currently returns 404 while non-public.
- Fresh recovery point: `/root/tehnet-backups/20260915-012653`.
- Non-TehNet runtime fingerprint remained unchanged across SEO deployment.
- `/learn/mikrotik/` is live and returned HTTP 200 with exactly one H1, correct canonical and `noindex,nofollow`.
- Current public YouTube inventory contains 33 mapped videos; no thin per-video site pages were created.
- Five Services owner URLs are live and verified: `/services/network-tehran/`, `/services/network-support-tehran/`, `/services/network-setup-tehran/`, `/services/mikrotik-tehran/`, `/services/remote-support/`.
- Each service owner returns HTTP 200 at origin and through Cloudflare, exactly one H1, correct canonical and `noindex,nofollow`.
- The legacy `tn_service` rewrite was disabled because it captured `/services/<slug>/` before hierarchical Pages; production currently has zero `tn_service` posts.
- Services-phase recovery points: `/root/tehnet-backups/20260921-005938` and `/root/tehnet-backups/20260921-010347`.

## SEO architecture locked
- `/learn/`, `/lab/`, `/services/`, `/shop/` are separate journeys.
- First-priority Learn owner: `/learn/mikrotik/`.
- Service owners include `/services/network-tehran/`, `/services/network-support-tehran/`, `/services/network-setup-tehran/`, `/services/mikrotik-tehran/`, `/services/remote-support/`.
- Shop intent belongs to category/product pages, not tutorials.
- No auto-generated thin pages per YouTube video and no fake district/city doorway pages.

## Important implementation facts
- `tn_service` and `tn_lab` archives are disabled to avoid collisions with `/services/` and `/lab/` pages; single rewrites remain nested beneath those slugs.
- `page.php` owns the H1 for normal pages; `front-page.php` leaves the editorial homepage H1 to page content.
- WP-CLI used here has no `wp menu get`; Persian menu discovery uses the tested `ops/lib/wp-menu-id.awk` parser.
- Current `robots.txt` only disallows `/wp-admin/`; actual prelaunch index blocking is the rendered meta robots plus `blog_public=0`.

## Exact next task
Create a new isolated branch/plan for **centralized LocalBusiness/NAP output**. Use the existing TehNet settings as the source of truth, emit only truthful/complete identity and service-area fields, add validation/regression tests, and keep `blog_public=0` plus rendered `noindex,nofollow` until the explicit launch gate.

## Safety
Do not change port `18082`, Nginx routing, Docker project topology or unrelated services. Before each production content/code deployment, capture a fresh TehNet backup and compare the non-TehNet runtime fingerprint before/after.

## Still unresolved
- Rial gateway provider.
- NoPayments official API/webhook implementation details.
- Final optional logo redesign (must be previewed before replacement).
- Search Console connection/measurement and final launch-indexing approval.
