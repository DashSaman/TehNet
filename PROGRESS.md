# TehNet Execution Progress

## Current phase / فاز فعلی
- **FA:** زیرساخت WooCommerce، کاتالوگ Shop و جریان استعلام محصولات فیزیکی در production پیاده‌سازی و live-verified شده‌اند؛ سایت همچنان عمداً noindex است. فاز بعدی پیشنهادی، چرخه دستی Quote/Invoice برای همین inquiryهاست.
- **EN:** WooCommerce catalog foundations and the physical-product inquiry flow are implemented and live-verified in production while the site intentionally remains noindex. The next proposed phase is the manual Quote/Invoice lifecycle for these inquiries.

## Completed and verified
- Product discovery, architecture spec, agent contract, roadmap and backlog.
- Safe production baseline, backup/recovery policy and isolated branch/worktree workflow.
- Persian RTL TehNet theme and `tehnet-core` settings/content-model foundation.
- WordPress installed/configured at `tehnet.ir`, locale `fa_IR`, editable Gutenberg pages/menu seeded.
- TehNet remains bound only to `127.0.0.1:18082`; unrelated services are protected by fingerprint checks.
- Persian query universe and dated SERP intent map created without fabricated Iran Volume/KD.
- Stable information architecture and internal-linking rules defined for Learn/Lab/Services/Shop.
- `/services/` and `/lab/` archive collisions removed while preserving single-item rewrites.
- Normal pages and homepage templates now enforce a single-H1 model.
- Existing top-level pages reseeded idempotently; WP-CLI Persian menu lookup regression fixed with tested CSV parser.
- Live routes `/`, `/learn/`, `/lab/`, `/services/`, `/shop/`, `/about/`, `/contact/` each returned HTTP 200 with exactly one H1 and correct canonical.
- `blog_public=0` and rendered `noindex,nofollow` remain active; indexing was not enabled.
- Core sitemap currently returns 404 while non-public; current `robots.txt` only protects `/wp-admin/`, which is documented rather than guessed.
- Fresh SEO-phase recovery point: `/root/tehnet-backups/20260915-011313`.
- Non-TehNet runtime fingerprint matched exactly before/after SEO deployment.
- Public YouTube inventory captured with 33 current videos and stable video IDs; every video is mapped exactly once to `OWNER`, `NOT-YET`, `YOUTUBE-ONLY` or `DEPRECATED`.
- Off-topic iPhone items remain YouTube-only; the explicitly old Cloudflare 1101 video is marked deprecated instead of receiving an SEO page.
- First substantial Learn owner `/learn/mikrotik/` is live, editable in Gutenberg, and includes original learning-path guidance plus verified TehNet videos.
- `/learn/mikrotik/` returned HTTP 200, exactly one H1, canonical `https://tehnet.ir/learn/mikrotik/`, and `noindex,nofollow`.
- Fresh content-phase recovery point: `/root/tehnet-backups/20260915-012653`.
- Non-TehNet runtime fingerprint remained exactly unchanged during the content seed.
- Five approved service owners are live: `/services/network-tehran/`, `/services/network-support-tehran/`, `/services/network-setup-tehran/`, `/services/mikrotik-tehran/`, `/services/remote-support/`.
- All five service owners returned HTTP 200 at origin and through Cloudflare with exactly one H1, correct canonical and `noindex,nofollow`.
- `/services/` now links to all five owner pages and remains editable in Gutenberg.
- A production 404 caused by the legacy `tn_service` rewrite collision was reproduced, covered by regression tests and fixed by disabling that unused pretty rewrite.
- Fresh recovery points: `/root/tehnet-backups/20260921-005938` and `/root/tehnet-backups/20260921-010347`.
- Non-TehNet runtime topology remained unchanged throughout the Services deployment.
- Centralized LocalBusiness JSON-LD is live on homepage, About, Contact, Services hub and all five service owners, with truthful NAP/service-area values and no fabricated ratings/hours/geo.
- LocalBusiness JSON is intentionally absent from `/learn/mikrotik/`; `BLOG_PUBLIC=0` and rendered `noindex,nofollow` remain active.
- LocalBusiness recovery point: `/root/tehnet-backups/20260921-011103`; non-TehNet topology remained unchanged.
- `/learn/mikrotik/mtcna/` is live and verified at origin/public with one H1, correct canonical, noindex/nofollow, all eight mapped MTCNA/GNS3 videos and required internal links.
- MTCNA recovery point: `/root/tehnet-backups/20260921-011812`; non-TehNet topology remained unchanged.
- Fresh SERP review supports the MTCNA owner but not generic VPN/Linux hubs yet; those remain NOT-YET rather than creating thin/cannibalizing pages.
- **FA:** WooCommerce `11.1.1` فعال است؛ `/shop/` و `/shop/mikrotik-routers/` در Public/Origin با HTTP 200، یک H1، canonical صحیح و `noindex,nofollow` تأیید شدند.
- **EN:** WooCommerce `11.1.1` is active; `/shop/` and `/shop/mikrotik-routers/` were verified at public edge and origin with HTTP 200, one H1, exact canonical and `noindex,nofollow`.
- **FA:** Cart/Checkout/My Account و تمام gatewayهای داخلی غیرفعال‌اند؛ smoke استعلام PASS شد و بعد از cleanup تعداد product و inquiry موقت صفر است.
- **EN:** Cart/Checkout/My Account and all built-in gateways are disabled; the inquiry smoke passed and cleanup left zero temporary products/inquiries.
- **FA/EN:** Shop recovery point / نقطه بازیابی فروشگاه: `/root/tehnet-backups/20260921-021149`; non-TehNet runtime topology remained unchanged.

## Current production state
- Active theme: `tehnet`; active plugins: `tehnet-core` + WooCommerce `11.1.1`.
- Static editable homepage and primary navigation are live.
- Canonical host is `https://tehnet.ir`.
- Search indexing remains deliberately disabled until launch gates pass.
- No secret values are stored in Git.

## Next execution order
1. Design and implement the manual Quote/Invoice lifecycle for physical inquiries / طراحی و پیاده‌سازی چرخه دستی پیش‌فاکتور و فاکتور.
2. Implement account/support/ticket flows and Telegram bridge in separate tested branches.
3. Implement digital delivery/licensing and payment adapters only after provider requirements are verified.
4. Revisit VPN/Linux owner hubs only with independent intent evidence and substantial content.
5. Complete launch technical/content/measurement gates before enabling indexing.

## Rules for all agents
Read `AGENTS.md` and `HANDOFF.md` first, preserve locked decisions and verified work, use evidence before SEO claims, keep indexing disabled until an explicit launch gate, and never change unrelated project ports/containers during TehNet work.
